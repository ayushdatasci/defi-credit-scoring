## Behavioral Analysis

### Low Score Wallets (300-500 Range) - 347 Wallets (9.9%)

*Characteristics of Poor to Below-Average Performing Wallets:*

- *Average Liquidation Ratio*: 0.8% - Significantly higher than average (0.2%)
- *Repayment Behavior*: 0.73 repay-to-borrow ratio - Poor loan management
- *Transaction Volume*: 24.3 average transactions - Below dataset average
- *Bot-like Behavior*: 12.4% exhibit automated patterns
- *Activity Consistency*: 0.31 - Irregular usage patterns
- *Asset Diversification*: 1.2 average unique assets - Limited diversification

*Common Patterns:*

- Higher frequency of liquidation events (4x average rate)
- Irregular repayment schedules indicating poor financial planning
- Concentration of activity in specific time windows suggesting automated behavior
- Limited asset diversification showing lack of risk management
- Short bursts of activity followed by long periods of inactivity

*Risk Indicators:*

- High liquidation-to-transaction ratios
- Poor repayment discipline
- Potential MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) extraction behavior
- Single-asset concentration risk

### High Score Wallets (700-1000 Range) - 771 Wallets (22.1%)

*Characteristics of High-Quality Wallets:*

- *Average Liquidation Ratio*: 0.1% - Minimal liquidation events
- *Repayment Behavior*: 0.98 repay-to-borrow ratio - Excellent loan management
- *Transaction Volume*: 35.7 average transactions - Above dataset average
- *Activity Consistency*: 0.42 - Regular, predictable usage patterns
- *Asset Diversification*: 2.1 average unique assets - Well-diversified portfolios
- *Popular Asset Usage*: 78% - Strong preference for stable assets

*Common Patterns:*

- Consistent, long-term protocol engagement over multiple months
- Responsible borrowing with timely and complete repayments
- Diversified asset usage across multiple tokens (USDC, DAI, USDT, WETH)
- Natural human-like transaction timing patterns across various hours
- Gradual increase in activity and sophistication over time
- Strong preference for established, liquid assets

*Value Indicators:*

- Long-term protocol loyalty and sustained engagement
- Stable liquidity provision and responsible borrowing
- Conservative risk management with minimal liquidations
- Organic user growth patterns indicating genuine adoption

## Model Performance Validation

### Score Stability Analysis

- *Temporal Consistency*: Scores remain stable across different time periods within the dataset
- *Feature Sensitivity*: Model demonstrates appropriate sensitivity to behavioral changes
- *Edge Case Handling*: Extreme values (very high/low transaction counts) are properly normalized
- *Distribution Quality*: Realistic bell curve distribution centered around 650 points

### Business Logic Validation

- *Manual Review*: Top 1% (scores >900) and bottom 1% (scores <400) manually validated
- *Expected Patterns*: High-volume users with good repayment behavior consistently score above 700
- *Risk Alignment*: Known risky patterns (liquidations, bot behavior) appropriately penalized
- *Component Balance*: All four scoring components contribute meaningfully to final scores

## Key Insights

### 1. Repayment Behavior Dominates Credit Assessment

The most significant predictor of credit score is repayment behavior, accounting for 54.8% of the model’s decision-making. Wallets with >95% repay-to-borrow ratios consistently score above 700, while those with <80% ratios rarely exceed 500.

### 2. Bot Detection Through Temporal Analysis

The model successfully identifies bot-like behavior through hour diversity analysis (23.6% importance). Wallets with extremely concentrated activity windows (hour_diversity < 0.2) and high transaction volumes show clear characteristics of automated trading or farming.

### 3. Quality User Base with Normal Distribution

The concentration of 63.6% of wallets in the 600-700 “Good” range indicates a healthy, genuine user base. The normal distribution around 651.5 suggests the scoring system appropriately differentiates user quality without artificial clustering.

### 4. Liquidation Events as Strong Risk Signals

Even minimal liquidation activity significantly impacts scores. The 248 liquidation events across the dataset (0.2% of transactions) primarily affect the lowest-scoring wallets, validating liquidations as strong negative indicators.

### 5. Asset Diversification Indicates Sophistication

Users of popular, stable assets (USDC, DAI, USDT) show 15-20% higher average scores than single-asset users, indicating better risk management and protocol understanding.

### 6. Long-term Engagement Premium

Wallets active across multiple months receive significant score boosts, with “unique days active” ranking as the 4th most important feature. This rewards protocol loyalty and sustained engagement.

## Recommendations

### For Protocol Development

1. *Incentivize High Scorers*: Offer preferential rates or exclusive features to wallets with scores >700 (22.1% of users)
1. *Monitor Medium Scorers*: The large 600-700 group (63.6%) represents growth opportunities for premium features
1. *Flag Low Scorers*: Implement additional scrutiny for the 9.9% of wallets scoring <500
1. *Dynamic Risk Pricing*: Use component scores to adjust interest rates and collateral requirements

### For Risk Management

1. *Automated Flagging*: Monitor wallets with sudden drops in repayment ratios
1. *Cohort Analysis*: The clear score distribution enables targeted user segmentation
1. *Predictive Modeling*: Use score trends to predict potential defaults or liquidations
1. *Portfolio Health*: Track the overall distribution shift as an ecosystem health metric

### For Model Improvements

1. *Cross-Protocol Integration*: Incorporate data from other DeFi protocols for comprehensive profiles
1. *Real-time Updates*: Implement streaming score updates for immediate behavior changes
1. *Market Context Integration*: Adjust scoring based on market volatility and protocol health
1. *Enhanced Bot Detection*: Expand temporal pattern analysis beyond hour diversity

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations

- *Single Protocol Scope*: Limited to Aave V2 on Polygon, missing cross-protocol behavior
- *Historical Data Only*: Six-month window may not capture full user lifecycle patterns
- *Limited Market Context*: No consideration of market conditions during the analysis period
- *Cold Start Problem*: New wallets require minimum transaction history for accurate scoring

### Future Enhancements

- *Multi-Protocol Scoring*: Combine data from Compound, Uniswap, and other major protocols
- *Real-time Score Updates*: Implement streaming analytics for immediate score changes
- *Machine Learning Ensemble*: Combine multiple models (Random Forest + Neural Networks + XGBoost)
- *Behavioral Clustering*: Identify and score distinct user archetypes (traders, farmers, HODLers)
- *Market Regime Analysis*: Adjust scores based on bull/bear market conditions

## Conclusion

The DeFi Credit Scoring System successfully analyzed 3,497 wallets and 100,000 transactions, producing a robust, interpretable credit assessment framework. The results demonstrate a healthy user ecosystem with the majority (63.6%) of wallets exhibiting good financial behavior.
